# Sentiment-analysis
Sentiment analysis of persian instagram comments

## 📄 Project Overview
This mini project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on social media comments to classify them into **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiments using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.

The project is designed to be **language-independent** by translating non-English text into English before analysis.

## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Dataset Name:** Instagram Persian Comments Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Content:** User-generated Persian (Farsi) comments collected from Instagram posts.  
- **Purpose:** To analyze public sentiment expressed in social media comments.

Since the original dataset contains **Persian-language comments**, all comments were **translated into English** to ensure compatibility with standard NLP preprocessing techniques and machine learning models.

## 🌍 Language Independence Handling
To handle language dependency:
- Persian comments were **translated into English** using a translation approach.
- This step enabled the use of **English NLP libraries** such as NLTK.
- The translation process makes the system **scalable and adaptable** to other languages in the future.
